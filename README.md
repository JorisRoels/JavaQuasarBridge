# JavaQuasarBridge
The JavaQuasarBridge project offers a Java interface for [Quasar](http://gepura.io/quasar/). Quasar is an accessible and high level programming language that leverages from parallel computing (e.g. GPUs). 

The JavaQuasarBridge is currently used in the [DenoisEM](http://bioimagingcore.be/DenoisEM/) EM image denoising plugin for ImageJ.
